# easy-pyinstaller
this is created in tkinter and that is the easy way to convert py files with pyinstaller ofc you need pyinstaller already installed 
there are no bugs and if there is just comment it
(linux didn't tested yet: this need to run on linux too i dont see any problem but i didnt test it yet)

hope its gonna help someone or make it easyer for you
